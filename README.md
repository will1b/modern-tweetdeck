# Modernized TweetDeck

A CSS-modification for the popular twitter client 'TweetDeck'

**WARNING:** This CSS can't be applied directly *without* a plugin/app for your browser that allows userstyles on certain webpages. I recommend Stylish/userstyles.org

## Requirements

* A browser supporting userstyles
* Segoe UI installed (might switch to a more open font sometime, tho)

## Installation

I use Chrome in combination with Stylish to explain how to apply that CSS.

### How to find Stylish and the Theme-Adding Options

* Right Click on the Stylish Icon and choose Manage, *this will take you to the Chrome App-Screen*
* At the bottom of the Stylish-'row', click Options, *you are now in the Stylish-Theme Manager*
* Click on "Write New Style"

### Style-Preferences

* Call the Style how you want, I suggest *Modernized TweetDeck* or something like that.
* Create some rules and point them to the following URLs to change the CSS: `https://tweetdeck.twitter.com` and `https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/#`
* Paste in the text from `style.css` into the textbox.
* Click on **Save** and look on TweetDeck!
