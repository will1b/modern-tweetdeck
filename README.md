# Modernized TweetDeck

A CSS-modification for the popular twitter client 'TweetDeck'

**WARNING:** This CSS can't be applied directly *without* a plugin/app for your browser that allows userstyles on certain webpages. I recommend Stylish/userstyles.org

## Requirements

* A browser supporting userstyles
* Any Browser that is not Internet Explorer, *I highly doubt it will work there.*

## Installation

I use Chrome in combination with Stylish to explain how to apply that CSS.

### How to find Stylish and the Theme-Adding Options

* Right Click on the Stylish Icon and choose Manage, *this will take you to the Chrome App-Screen*
* At the bottom of the Stylish-'row', click Options, *you are now in the Stylish-Theme Manager*
* Click on "Write New Style"

### Style-Preferences

* Call the Style how you want, I suggest *Modernized TweetDeck* or something like that.
* Create some rules and point them to the following URLs to change the CSS: `https://tweetdeck.twitter.com`, `https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/#`, `https://web.tweetdeck.com` or `https://web.tweetdeck.com/#`
* Paste in the text from `style.css` into the textbox.
* Click on **Save** and look on TweetDeck!
